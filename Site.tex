\chapter{Observing at the Marion Island Site}

Low-frequency observations require high angular resolution to improve the experiment's sensitivity. Systematics discussed in \S\ref{s:chall} widely dominate the experiments operating at frequencies $<$\SI{200}{MHz}. RFI from the frequency modulation (FM) transmitters is a substantial contributor in the low-frequency regime; thus, FM contamination is widespread into observation bands. Observing from remote deployment sites is a solution to the FM band contamination issue. Before site selection and deployment, radio environments must match the specific instrument's requirements when assessed. Accessibility is a common challenge that arises from remote site selection. Therefore, choosing a good observing location is generally a balance between	accessibility and radio-quietness. 

Marion Island was chosen as the observing site for Probing Radio Intensity at high-Z from Marion~\citep[\prizm;][]{2019JAI.....850004P} and the Array of Long Baseline Antennas for Taking Radio Observations from the Sub-Antarctic~\citep[\albatros;][]{2020arXiv200812208C} after evaluating the mentioned factors. Marion Island is the exceptionally radio-quiet environment for low-frequency observations, although the site is only accessible annually. The next section discusses the location in more detail.

\section{Marion Island}

Marion Island is a research base that forms part of the Prince Edward Islands shown in Figure~\ref{fig:marion}, located in the southern Indian Ocean at \ang{46;54;45}S, \ang{37;44;37}E. The South African National Antarctic Programme (SANAP) and the South African Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) operate the research base shown in Figure~\ref{fig:base}. The island is $\sim$ \SI{2000}{\kilo\metre} from the nearest continental landmasses ~\citep{2019JAI.....850004P}. Marion has an area of 290~km$^2$, and the main base is positioned on the northeast side of the island. Marion Island has a volcanic origin, and the terrain is scattered with many secondary craters and small lakes. There are abundant snow and rain, and the vegetation is mainly mosses and ferns. The lowland regions are marshy due to high precipitation. It is extremely windy and	mostly cloudy throughout the year.

The DEA owns the S. A. Agulhas II \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S. A. Agulhas II}}, a South African ice-breaking polar supply and research ship that services the island every year in April. During the relief voyage in April, three weeks are spent on the island deploying and maintaining the existing instruments. Marion Island caters for various research fields such as meteorology, mammalogy, ornithology, and botany. The main Marion base accommodates all the researchers participating in the relief voyage and overwintering team members. Figure~\ref{fig:site} shows the nine rest huts (Kildalkey, Watertunnel, Cape Davis, Grey-headed, Mixed Pickle, Repettos, Rooks, Swartkops, and, Katedraal) that researchers use while traversing the island. The \prizm\ instrument was deployed at the \prizm\ site (\ang{46;53;13}S, \ang{37;49;10.7}E) as the first radio astronomy experiment in Marion Island, followed by the \albatros\ experiment on the same site.

\section{Advantages of Observing from Marion Island}

The discussion that follows is described by~\citep{2019JAI.....850004P}. In choosing the observing site for \prizm and \albatros, several radio spectrum measurements were done on different sites, including the South African Karoo desert. The radio-quiet environment of Marion Island surpasses that of the South African Karoo desert, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:karoo}. At Marion Island site, there is no evident detection of RFI contamination in the FM band besides the Orbcomm satellite transmission visible at \SIrange{137}{138}{\mega\hertz} and the \SI{250}{\mega\hertz} FPGA clock artifact visible at \SI{125}{\mega\hertz}. The enhanced RFI from meteor scattering is a common threat in several remote sites excluding Marion Island, as there have not been evident measurements of such RFI.

	\caption{Comparison of radio spectrum on Marion (thick red) and in the Karoo desert (thin black). The fractional amplitude above a background fit to the raw and uncalibrated data without RFI excision. Orbcomm satellite transmission is visible at 137â€“138 MHz; there is no visible RFI in Marion's data. The feature at 125 MHz is an artifact of the 250 MHz FPGA clock and not due to RFI~\citep{2019JAI.....850004P}}

Figure~\ref{fig:rfi} shows the RFI spectrum comparison between the \prizm deployment site \SI{4}{\kilo\metre} away from the island's main base. Locally generated RFI less impacts the \prizm site. Junior's Kop situated between the deployment site and the island's main base provides enhanced RFI shielding of \SI{\sim60}{\decibel}. The helicopter was operating near the base when the RFI measurements were taken and transmitting at a frequency of \SI{123.45}{\mega\hertz}.

\begin{figure}

	\caption{RFI measurement differentiated from the Marion base and the \prizm observing site. When the measurements were taken, the spectrum analyzer was set to max hold, and the measurement period coincided with the helicopter's operation near the base and transmitting at \SI{123.45}{\mega\hertz}. A rough benchmark of $\sim$60 dB signal suppression in received power at both locations arising from a combination of attenuation from Junior's kop and the distance between the \prizm site and the base. The peak at 156 MHz is a transmission from a handheld radio~\citep{2019JAI.....850004P}.}

Figure~\ref{fig:IRI_model} shows the international reference ionosphere (IRI) model~\citep{ars-16-1-2018} predictions illustrating the minimum ionospheric plasma cutoff frequency during the last solar minima. The development of new low-frequency experiments is predominantly driven by the lack of knowledge of what lies in the sky at frequencies $\lessapprox$\SI{30}{\mega\hertz}.  According to the international reference ionospheric (IRI) model prediction, measurements of the sky at $\lessapprox$\SI{30}{\mega\hertz} do not look entirely impossible because, during the last solar minima, the ionospheric plasma cutoff frequency was measured to be $\sim$\SI{1.5}{\mega\hertz} at Marion Island. Since we are currently experiencing another solar minimum~\citep{2018NatCo...9.5209B}, it is an excellent opportunity to develop and implement new low-frequency observations. The prediction shows Marion Island, Dome C in Antarctica, and Hobart in Tasmania, where Reber performed his \SI{2}{\mega\hertz} observation. They have the potential to provide new views of the Earth's ionosphere, which absorbs and refracts at radio frequencies and becomes utterly opaque below the plasma cutoff frequency. In the next two chapters, the \prizm\ and \albatros\ experiments are discussed in detail.
